# Extensions

### Extension Functions

Extension functions are a way of adding new behavior to existing classes, even if the source code for the existing classes is not available.
If an existing class seems to be lacking of some important functionality, it could be supplemented with an extension function.

An extension function does not modify the original class it is added to. It is added as a static import in the compilation unit it is used. 

An extension function behaves as if it is just a part of the class it is added to, so it can use *this*.
