### Variables

Everything is an object in Kotlin. It does not have primitive types. 

What are primitive types in Java, like int, float, boolean etc. are objects in Kotlin.

**Mutable Variables** 

```kotlin
    var num: Int = 10
    var number = 5
```

**Immutable Variables** 

```kotlin
    val num: Int = 10
    val number = 5
```
